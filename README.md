<p>I am excited to share that I have completed my 1st task of this Internship, which is to develop a Stopwatch Application. I used HTML to structure the basic elements, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for adding functionalities. This Web Application is interactive and user-friendly. </p>

# <p>Basic features/functions of the Stopwatch Application include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>To start the Timer.</li>
  <li>To stop/pause the Timer.</li>
  <li>To reset the Timer.</li>
  <li>To track and display lap times.</li>
</ul>
